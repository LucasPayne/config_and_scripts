# LF-LANGUAGE UTILITIES
#<<<
#https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/wiki/Tips
# eval: Run an lf command after expanding $ shell syntax (envvars and command substitution).
# lf-language doesn't have an env-var syntax.
# However it can access env-vars from subshells,
# and subshells can send commands to lf.
# So, routing a command line through a subshell
# has the effect of expanding environment variables.
#NOTE: This is run as an async command.
#      It is useless(?) to run blocking as the lf -remote is async itself.
#      So can only use this to spawn "jobs",
