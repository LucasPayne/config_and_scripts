# vim_remote_call: Wrapper for vim_remote_expr which makes a function call.
# Usage:
#     vim_remote_call {cmd} [{args...}]
#     vim_remote_call chdir "$(pwd)"
#
# TODO: Argument types other than strings.
# Could use syntax
#     vim_remote_call win_execute "win_getid(1)" "quit" -e 1
#     -e 1 indicating that argument 1 is an expression to place without quotation.
#     (Or, could allow it to be always expressions. But then it would be needed to do:
#         vim_remote_call chdir "$(vim_escape_string "$(pwd)")".
#         Depends which one is more common to be the default.)
